			Using this dialog, you can request coins from another person (who should already have installed Infinitecoin Wallet).
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you can enter an amount of Infinitecoins to request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, you either have the generated QR code scanned by the other person.
			Or, you can send your request to a remote person with the share button in the action bar.
			The other person will have to click the Infinitecoin URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either way, the other person will be presented a dialog for sending coins with all fields pre-populated.
			If she accepts, all she needs to do is sending the payment.
