			<li>
                Infinitecoins are stored on the device.
				<b>If you lose it, you'll lose your Infinitecoins.</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
				Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
				Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Infinitecoins to another wallet</b>.
				Remaining Infinitecoins will be lost.
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
				If you send your Infinitecoins into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.

			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
